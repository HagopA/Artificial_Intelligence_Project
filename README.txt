HOW TO OPEN THE PROJECT
This program was made using the PyCharm ide from JetBrains.
Thus, the simplest way to run it is to open PyCharm, and then open the folder of the submission. 
(the folder containing the py files, the .idea and __pychache__ folders, etc.)
It is also possible to run it with the console line by simply taking the .py files into account.
Similarly, it is possible to run it by creating a new project in your ide of choice and including the python files in the submission.

RUN PROGRAM WITH GUI
To run the program with the GUI, simply click on the green arrow at the top right of the PyCharm window (or press Shift+F10).
With another ide or the console line, you have to run gui.py (the module gui) since the main is in that module.

RUN PROGRAM WITHOUT GUI
To run the program without the GUI, you have to uncomment the very last lines of the file board.py
This includes all the lines under the comment "# MAIN - uncomment to play without the GUI"
You could also comment out the lines under # MAIN in the file gui.py, but that is not necessary.
Then, run the module board (board.py).
In PyCharm, this is done by simply clicking on the green arrow at the top right of the PyCharm window (or pressing Shift+F10).
